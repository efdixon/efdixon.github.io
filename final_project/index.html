    <h1>Life as I Know it</h1>
      <h2>Welcome to my story! Below you'll find a variety of random facts about what it is that has comprised my life thus far. Dive in and enjoy!</h2>
      <h2 id="growingup">Growing up</h2>
        <h3>Younger Years</h3>
          <p class="teen_uni">Born in Fort Smith, Arkansas in the early 90s, I was born as the third child and second daughter to young parents, Keith and Elizabeth. My brother was 5 years old and my sister had just turned three 10 days before I was born. We moved up to <a href="https://www.fayetteville-ar.gov/"><strong>Fayetteville, Arkansas</strong></a> when I was just two years old.</p>
        <h3>Teen Angst and University</h3>
          <p class="teen_uni">I went to junior high school and ditched soccer for volleyball. Our uniforms were from the early 90s and included a collard sleeveless shirt and basketball shorts that were a size to big for most of us. I met people from schools outside my middle school and elementary years and began to pursue the arts. Once I got to highschool, I kept with volleyball until senior year where I ditched volleyball and went back to soccer where I ended up tearing my ACL senior year.I went to the University of Arkansas in my hometown where I spent 4 years switching 3 majors and eventually graduating with a bachelors degree in Early Childhood Development.</p>
      <h3>Modern Day</h3>
        <p>Currently, I live in Washington, DC. The city is quite a change from the homeliness of small town Arkansas, but offers so much in the way of experiences, music, food, food, and more food.</p>
